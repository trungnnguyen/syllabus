## Assignments

1. (due 1/31/17) 
 * Sign up for an account at [GitHub](https://github.com) (if you don't have one already), and email me your GitHub username, so that I can add you to the UNH-HPC organization. 
 * Sign up for [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/unh-hpc/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)
 * Make sure that you can log in to fishercat, either from your laptop or a lab computer (or both).

2. (due 2/2/17)
 * Following the Class 2 notes, finish putting up a personal wiki page and link it to the [Students](https://github.com/unh-hpc/syllabus/wiki/Students) page.
 * Make sure that you can edit and compile a simple C program using the command line - either on fishercat or on your laptop (no need to hand anything in).
 * Edit the [Topics](https://github.com/unh-hpc/syllabus/wiki/Topics) page and add + / - to topics you would like to see emphasized or skipped.
 * Not due yet, but considering signing up for a presentation by editing [this page](https://github.com/unh-hpc/syllabus/wiki/Student-Presentations).

3. (due 2/7/17)
 * It'd be nice if you could add your real name to your GitHub account (click on the top right icon, select "Your Profile"), and even better if you could add an image. If you have privacy concerns, though, it's okay to not do this.
 * If you haven't done so, click on the "Watch" button (also near the top) for this (the syllabus) repo. If you watch this repo, github will send you notifications if anything changes, in particular if the assignment page gets updated.
 * If you have issues with following what we did in class, e.g., using an editor to write code, using VNC to log on to fishercat, etc, these things can be quite complex to set up, in particular if you're on Windows. Try to come to my office before the next class so that we can work these things out, and so that you're ready to finish the rest of your homework.
 * The actual homework: Finish the in-class tasks from [Class 3](https://github.com/unh-hpc/syllabus/wiki/Class-3): split out factorial.c, and add a Makefile that can be used to compile the code that's then split amongst three source files. Figure out some way to submit your homework to me (via email). If you happen to know your way around git, that could be a good way, but otherwise you can tell me where to find your work on fishercat, or attach the files to an email, put them into Dropbox or whatever. It'd be good to get the code to compile without warnings, too!
 * Read the [paper](BarelySufficientSoftwareEngineering.pdf) on barely sufficient software engineering through 2.5. Be ready to answer a question on what you read or talk about a point you found interesting.
 
4. (due 2/9/17)
 * Finish the in-class exercises from [Class 4](https://github.com/unh-hpc/syllabus/wiki/Class-4). Up the version number to 0.03, make a tarball and email that to me (or tell me where on fishercat to find it).
 * Finish reading the paper on barely sufficient software engineering.
 
5. (due 2/14/17)
 * To partially make up for the snow day, I wrote up some introduction to doing more with git/github [here](https://github.com/unh-hpc/syllabus/wiki/Snow-Class-5). It's a bit lengthy, and it's a good idea to follow along trying things yourself, but not a whole lot of things you really need to do.
 * At the end, you should have your `class-4-in-class-xyz` repo pushed back to github, so that I can check it out.
 
6. (due 2/16/17) 
 * Not much of a homework, but please sign up for a [presentation](https://github.com/unh-hpc/syllabus/wiki/Student-Presentations) and pick a date, otherwise I will do that for you.
 
7. (due *before class* 2/21/17)
 * Finish the work on [Class 7](https://github.com/unh-hpc/syllabus/wiki/Class-7). Commit your changes and push them back to github.
